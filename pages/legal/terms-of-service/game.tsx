        <p>
            1) You may be required to register or have a Gaming Account (&quot;Account&quot;) in
            order to use the Project SEED Services. When you register an Account, you
            must provide the information requested by Project SEED, and accept these
            Terms, the Privacy Policy, and other Project SEED Platform Rules. Project
            SEED may refuse, in its discretion, to open an Account for you. &nbsp;To
            create an Account, you will be required to register as a User and the system
            will automatically generate a blockchain address for you (“Vault”), which
            allows you to engage to Project SEED Game(s) that are built on blockchain
            networks&nbsp;by Project SEED (the each, a “Blockchain Platform”) using
            smart contracts. Your blockchain address functions as your identity on
            Project SEED Game(s). Accordingly your Account on the Service will be
            associated with your blockchain address.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            2) You may establish an Account only if you are a natural person and an
            adult in your country of residence and you are not an individual
            specifically prohibited by us from using the Project SEED Services.

                used during your game play. You acknowledge and agree not to use a
                Nickname which is obscene or otherwise offensive. We are entitled (but
                not obliged) to filter out certain words and phrases that we consider
                unacceptable. Besides, while any registration process that we adopt may
                filter out certain unacceptable words and phrases, it can never be a
                comprehensive filter. Also, we reserve the right to terminate your
                usership or Account and have the right to require your re-registration
                with a new acceptable Nickname if, in our discretion, we consider that
                your Nickname (or its use) is offensive or otherwise breaches the user

            information and documents are processed and reviewed by Project SEED and
            accepted as satisfying the requirements of applicable law, regulation, or
            policy. If you do not provide complete and accurate information and
            documents in response to such a request, Project SEED may refuse to restore
            your access to Project SEED Services.

        <p>
            11) Your Account may only support certain digital assets on certain
            blockchain networks. You acknowledge that any transfer or deposits or
            withdrawals of any digital assets other than supported digital assets, will
            cause the loss of such digital assets and cannot be retrieved. You are
            solely responsible for such loss and Project SEED shall not be liable to you
            for any losses due to the transactions of unsupported digital assets.&nbsp;

                constitute securities under applicable legal requirements. You hereby
                irrevocably disclaim and disavow reliance upon any statements or

                price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the
                Items, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. We
                cannot and do not guarantee that any purchasers or owner of Items or
                Game Tokens will not lose money.

                A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of
                distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those

            Dispute Resolution. Please read the arbitration agreement in this section
            (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It contains procedures for MANDATORY
            BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.

                Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You agree that all claims and
                disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as
                set forth below) in connection with this Agreement or the use of Project
                SEED Services provided by Project SEED that cannot be resolved
                informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding
                arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration
                Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall
                be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and
                Project SEED, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees,
                predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all
                authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods
                provided under these Terms.

            <li>
            <p>
                Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before either party
                may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a
                written notice describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute
                and the requested relief (“Notice of Dispute”). A Notice of Dispute to
                Project SEED should be sent to: PT. Benih Permainan Internasional, Jl.
                Sultan Iskandar Muda 18F, Jakarta Selatan, Indonesia. After the Notice
                of Dispute is received, you and Project SEED may attempt to resolve the
                claim or dispute informally. Both you and Project SEED agree to meet and
                confer personally, by telephone, or by videoconference (hereinafter
                “Conference”) to discuss the dispute and attempt in good faith to reach
                a mutually beneficial outcome that avoids the expenses of arbitration
                or, where applicable, litigation. If you are represented by counsel,
                your counsel may participate in the Conference as well, but you agree to
                fully participate in the Conference. Likewise, if Project SEED is
                represented by counsel, its counsel may participate in the Conference as
                well, but Project SEED agrees to have a company representative fully
                participate in the Conference. The statute of limitations and any filing
                fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal
                dispute resolution process and Conference required by this paragraph. If
                you and Project SEED do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty
                (30) days after the Notice of Dispute is received, either party may
                begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made
                by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the
                arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which
                either party is entitled.

                Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated through the Singapore
                International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”), an established alternative
                dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as
                set forth in this section. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern
                all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method
                of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such
                rules are in conflict with these Terms. The Arbitration Rules of
                Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“Arbitration Rules”)
                governing the arbitration are available online at
                https://www.siac.org.sg/. The arbitration shall be conducted by a
                single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total
                amount of the award sought is less than Six Thousand Singapore Dollars
                (SGD $6,000.00) may be resolved through Expedited Procedure, at the
                option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the
                total amount of the award sought is Six Thousand Singapore Dollars (SGD
                $6,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the
                Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100
                miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of Singapore, and
                unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of Singapore.,
                the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date,
                time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered
                by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
                If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last
                settlement offer that Project SEED made to you prior to the initiation
                of arbitration, Project SEED will pay you the greater of the award or
                $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s
                fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an
                equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.

                Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. If non-appearance based arbitration is
                elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or
                based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen
                by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not
                involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless
                otherwise agreed by the parties.

                Time Limits.To the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, any
                claim arising from or in connection with this Agreement and/or the
                Project SEED Services, must commence within one year after you shall
                first become aware of or within one year after the claim or cause of
                action accrues (whichever is earlier). If it is not filed within that
                time, then the claim is permanently barred.

                Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator
                will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Project SEED,
                and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or
                joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have
                exclusive authority to (i) determine the scope and enforceability of
                this Arbitration Agreement; and (ii) resolve any dispute related to the
                interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this
                Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all
                or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable; and shall
                also have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of
                any claim. The exceptions to the preceding sentence are (1) all disputes
                arising out of or relating to the class action waiver, including any
                claim that all or part of the class action waiver is unenforceable,
                illegal, void or voidable, or such class action waiver has been
                breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not
                by an arbitrator; (2) all disputes arising out of or relating to the
                payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of
                competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (3) all disputes
                arising out of or relating to whether either party has satisfied any
                condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of
                competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The arbitrator shall
                have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any
                non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under
                applicable law, the SIAC Rules, and these Terms. The arbitrator shall
                issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential
                findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the
                calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same
                authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court
                of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon
                you and Project SEED. Any judgment on the award rendered by the
                arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

                Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND
                STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR
                A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved
                by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures
                are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules
                applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court.
                In the event any litigation should arise between you and Project SEED in
                any state or country court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration
                award or otherwise, YOU AND PROJECT SEED WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY

                THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED
                ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN
                ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR
                CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If a decision is
                issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this
                subsection’s limitations as to a given claim for relief, then the claim
                must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the court of
                Singapore. All other claims shall be arbitrated.

                shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain
                confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall
                not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information
                necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or

            Game(s) from all devices on which you’ve installed and immediately stop your
            use of the Project SEED Services. Upon any termination, you shall no longer
            exercise any of the rights granted to you and you must destroy all copies of
            the Project SEED Game(s) in your possession.
        </p>
        <p>
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite the termination/expiration of this Agreement, your obligations
            accumulated prior to the termination/expiration shall still be fulfilled by
            you. Also, all the rights and interests of Project SEED and the
            authorization (if any) granted to Project SEED shall still remain in effect
            and survive the termination of this Agreement.

        <p className={styles["text-bolder"]}>19. Severability</p>
        <p>
            If any provision of this Agreement is held to be void or declared illegal,
            invalid or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, such provision shall be
            divisible and deleted from this Agreement and the rest of this Agreement may
            not be affected and remain in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
            class action waiver is found invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, you agree
            that it may not be severable. In other words, under no circumstances shall
            arbitration be conducted on a class basis without the express prior written
            consent of Project SEED.
        </p>

        <p className={styles["text-bolder"]}>20. Governing Law</p>
        <p>
            1) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of
            Singapore excluding its conflict of law principles. You agree and
            acknowledge that any claims or legal actions between you and Project SEED
            shall be referred to Singapore International Arbitration Centre (&quot;SIAC&quot;) for
            arbitration which shall be conducted in accordance with SIAC’s arbitration
            rules. The arbitral award is final and binding upon both parties. If the
            above arbitration terms are not enforceable on any dispute, both parties
            agree that such dispute shall be brought in a court in Singapore. You hereby
            consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and/or
            forum non convenience with respect to venue and jurisdiction, whether by
            arbitration or judicial judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
            2) SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, BOTH PARTIES CONFIRM THAT ANY
            DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE
            CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
            ACTION.

        <p>
            <br />
        </p>

            rights or obligations under this Agreement, whether by operation of law or
            otherwise, without the express prior written consent of Project SEED.
            Otherwise, Project SEED may, in its sole discretion, terminate providing any
            services to you without prior notice. If the restrictions on transfer are
            not enforceable under the law of your country or residence, then this
            Agreement will be binding on you and any of your recipient. Notwithstanding
            the foregoing, Project SEED shall be entitled to at any time assign,
            transfer, charge, or sub-contract all or any of its rights or obligations
            under this Agreement.

            4) Project SEED may translate this Agreement into other languages. If there
            is any difference between the English version and other language versions,
            then the English version, subject to applicable laws and regulations, shall
            prevail.
        </p>
        <p>
            5) In addition to any other limitations which may be set forth herein,
            Project SEED may not be responsible for any delay or failure to perform
            resulting from causes outside the reasonable control of Project SEED such as
            acts by governmental authorities, acts of God or other events outside of the
            reasonable control of Project SEED.

        <p>
            7) You represent that you are entering into this Agreement on a completely
            voluntary basis and you expect no compensation other than what is expressly
            granted under this Agreement.
