      <h4>2. Our Service</h4>
      <p>
        The Service is an online platform on which an individual can Mint (as
        defined below), purchase or offer to purchase, and sell or offer for sale
        unique non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) and any non-digital products, services
        and/or benefits to be furnished by or on behalf of sellers in connection
        with the sale of such NFTs (“Off-Chain Benefits,” collectively with the
        NFTs, “Items”), implemented on the one or more blockchain platform networks
        then-utilized by Project SEED (the each, a “Blockchain Platform”) using
        smart contracts.&nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />
        Your blockchain address functions as your identity on Project SEED’s NFT
        Marketplace. Accordingly, you will need a blockchain address and a
        third-party wallet to access the Service. Your account on the service
        (“<span>Account</span>”) will be associated with your blockchain address; however, if you
        want to add some flair to your Project SEED persona, you can add additional
        information, such as a profile picture, to your Account.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your Account on Project SEED will be associated with your linked blockchain
        address and display the Items for that blockchain address (and, if
        applicable, any content associated with such Items). By using your wallet in
        connection with the Service, you agree that you are using that wallet under
        the terms and conditions of the applicable provider of the wallet. Wallets
        are not operated by, maintained by, or affiliated with Project SEED, and
        Project SEED does not have custody or control over the contents of your
        wallet and has no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. Project SEED
        accepts no responsibility for, or liability to you, in connection with your
        use of a wallet and makes no representations or warranties regarding how the
        Service will operate with any specific wallet. You are solely responsible
        for keeping your wallet secure and you should never share your wallet
        credentials or seed phrase with anyone. If you discover an issue related to
        your wallet, please contact your wallet provider. Likewise, you are solely
        responsible for your Account and any associated wallet and we are not liable
        for any acts or omissions by you in connection with your Account or as a
        result of your Account or wallet being compromised. You agree to immediately
        notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security issues related
        to the Service or your Account (you can contact us&nbsp;
        <a href="mailto:contact@projectseed.io">here</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        You also represent and warrant that you will comply with all applicable laws
        (e.g., local, state, federal and other laws) when using the Service. Without
        limiting the foregoing, by using the Service, you represent and warrant
        that: (a) you are not located in a country that is subject to a United
        Nations Security Council Sanction or Singapore government embargo; and (b)
        you have not been identified as a Specially Designated National or placed on
        any United Nations or Singapore government list of prohibited, sanctioned,
        or restricted parties. If you access or use the Service outside Singapore,
        you are solely responsible for ensuring that your access and use of the
        Service in such country, territory or jurisdiction does not violate any
        applicable laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        Project SEED may require you to provide additional information and documents
        in certain circumstances, such as at the request of any government or
        competent authority, as any applicable law or regulation or policy dictates,
        including laws related to anti-money laundering (legalization) of incomes
        obtained by criminal means, or for counteracting financing of terrorism or
        to investigate a potential violation of these Terms. In such cases, Project
        SEED, in its sole discretion, may disable your Account and block your
        ability to access the Service or pause or cancel your transactions until
        such additional information and documents are processed and reviewed by
        Project SEED and accepted as satisfying the requirements of applicable law,
        regulation, or policy. If you do not provide complete and accurate
        information and documents in response to such a request, Project SEED may
        refuse to restore your access to the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your access and use of the Service may be interrupted from time to time for
        any of several reasons, including, without limitation, the malfunction of

            together with additional sale mechanisms as may be introduced from time
            to time. You may only participate in NFT sales by linking your digital
            wallets on supported bridge extensions or digital wallet services such
            as MetaMask which allows you to purchase, store, and engage in
            transactions relating to digital assets. In addition to trading on the
            platform, NFTs created may be transferred or resold outside of the
            website or Project SEED ecosystem.

            All pricing and payment terms are as indicated at point of sale or
            otherwise on the Service, and any payment obligations you incur are
            binding at the time of purchase. Please review carefully the terms of
            purchase of any Item before purchasing, including the terms of any
            licenses, payment rights, or Off-Chain Benefits relating to or
            incorporated into the Items (“<span>Purchase Terms</span>”). Project SEED is not a
            party to any transaction on the Service between sellers and actual or
            prospective purchasers, and any dispute related to a purchase of an Item
            on the Service shall be between the seller and actual or prospective
            purchasers of such Item and is not responsible for ensuring compliance
            with such terms or mediating or resolving any disputes with respect to
            such Purchase Terms, including, but not limited to, any disputes arising
            out of or related to the authenticity of the Item or any intellectual
            property rights associated with such Item. The Purchaser and Seller are
            entirely responsible for communicating, promulgating, agreeing to, and
            enforcing Purchase Terms, and for resolving any disputes arising from
            any breach of any Purchase Terms. Seller must comply with and fulfill
            the Purchase Terms with respect to any NFTs that it sells. When you
            purchase an Item through the Services, you own all personal property
            rights to the electronic record that comprises the NFT (i.e., the right
            to sell or otherwise dispose of that Item). Unless expressly specified
            in the Purchase Terms, such rights, however, do not include the
            ownership of the intellectual property rights in any Item Content.
            Rather, unless specified otherwise in the purchase terms, you have a
            license to use the Item Content solely for the following purposes: (1)
            for Purchaser’s own personal, non-commercial use; (2) attempts to sell
            or otherwise dispose of the Item consistent with the ownership of it;
            and (3) as part of a third party offering compatible with the purchased
            Item in the normal course of the permitted end-use of such offering.

        <li>
          <p>
            You may not substitute any other currency, whether cryptocurrency or
            fiat currency, for the currency in which you have contracted to pay at
            the time of purchase. For clarity, no fluctuation in the value of any
            currency, whether cryptocurrency or otherwise, shall impact or excuse
            your obligations with respect to any purchase.

            Project SEED may charge a fee to the Seller or Creator of any Item
            listed for sale on the Service (“Transaction Fee”). The amount of such
            Transaction Fee may be expressed as an absolute value or as a percentage
            of the&nbsp;amount received by the Seller or Creator for such Item
            (“<span>Revenue</span>”), in each case as indicated at the point of listing for such
            Item for sale on the Service.You further agree to pay all other
            applicable fees, including Gas Fees and hosting fees, and you authorize
            Project SEED to automatically charge you for any such fees or deduct
            such fees (including the Transaction Fee) directly from your amounts
            paid by the Purchaser. The payments made to Sellers or Creators do not
            include any Taxes, and Project SEED shall have no responsibility for
            payment of such Taxes regardless of the taxing authority. Each party
            shall be responsible for all Taxes imposed on its income or property.
            Purchasers will be responsible for paying all such fees. In addition,
            interactions with the Blockchain may also result in transaction fees or
            Gas Fees (as defined below) imposed by the Blockchain, which are also
            solely your responsibility. “Gas fees” mean the fees that fund the
            network of computers that run the decentralized blockchain network,
            meaning that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that
            occurs via the blockchain network.&nbsp;

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In connection with any subsequent sale of an Item after its initial sale
            on the Service (each such sale, a “Secondary Sale”), fees may be due to
            Project SEED from the seller of such Item (“Secondary Sale Fee”). Such
            Secondary Sale Fee may be coded into the Item and may apply to all
            Secondary Sales of the Item, whether or not such Secondary Sale takes
            place on the Service.

            In certain instances Project SEED may accept, process, and settle
            payments in cryptocurrency. In order to make a purchase of an Item using
            cryptocurrency, you must connect a digital wallet to the Service, in
            each case in accordance with the functionality of the Service. If the
            balance of such cryptocurrency in your Account is less than insufficient
            to cover the price of an Item at the time of purchase, you may not be
            able to purchase that Item using this such payment method of payment. In
            order to purchase an Item using a digital wallet, you may be required to
            first download a supported bridge extension in order and use such
            extension to connect and unlock your digital wallet through the Service.
            Once you submit an order to Mint or purchase an Item, your order is
            passed on to the applicable extension, which completes the transaction
            on your behalf. If the balance of such cryptocurrency in your Account is
            insufficient to cover the price of an Item at the time of purchase you
            may not be able to purchase that Item. Whether a particular
            cryptocurrency is accepted as a payment method by Project SEED is
            subject to change at any time in Project SEED’s sole discretion.

      <h4>4. Minting an Item</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            An individual who has created an Account (each, a “User”) may be able to
            use the Service to create or issue (“Mint”) an Item on a Blockchain
            Platform. By Minting an Item or otherwise using the Service, you agree
            to comply with any terms, including licenses or payment rights, that you
            embed within or otherwise include with the Item, and to disclose fully
            all such terms in the description of your listing of the Item on the
            Service.&nbsp;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If you are using the Services to create and issue, you are a “Creator”
            and agree to the following additional terms:&nbsp;
            <br />
            <span>(i) Royalties.</span>&nbsp;If you are a Creator, in each sale by other Sellers
            following your initial sale of your Item, you will receive the
            percentage of Revenue with respect to each such sale set forth in the
            applicable field of the Item at the time of creation (“<span>Artist Royalty
            Fee</span>”).&nbsp;
            <br />
            <span>(ii) Item Content</span>. As between Project SEED and you, you shall continue
            to exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to the digital
            art embodied in the Items and any name, likeness, image, signature,
            voice and other identifiable characteristics included in the digital art
            embodied in the Items, creative assets you provide to Project SEED, and
            your name, logos and trademarks, and all intellectual property rights in
            the foregoing (collectively, the “Item Content”). Notwithstanding the
            foregoing, you grant to Project SEED a perpetual, irrevocable,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid-up, license, with the
            right to sublicense through multiple tiers, to use Item Content for the
            purpose of performing Project SEED’s obligations under these Terms,
            including hosting the Item Content and listing, marketing and
            facilitating the sale of the Items, and marketing or promoting the
            Services.&nbsp;
            <br />
            <span>(iii) Creator Obligations and Perks</span>. You shall obtain all rights to the
            Item Content in connection with the use thereof by Project SEED as
            contemplated in these Terms, and the awarding and administration of the
            benefits that you sell or list in connection with the sale of your Item,
            as applicable, including, but not limited to: (a) clearing and obtaining
            any rights in connection with the Item Content, including any music
            performance rights and payment of royalties to any performing rights
            organizations; (b) acquiring any services or materials needed in
            connection with the Items and benefits offered to Purchasers; and (c)
            the costs and compliance for the benefits, including as specified in the
            Purchase Terms.&nbsp;
            <br />
            <span>(iv) Warranties</span>.&nbsp;You represent and warrant that (a) you have the
            full right, power and authority to grant the rights granted or agreed to
            be granted hereunder, including, but not limited to, fully cleared
            permissions, consents, rights and licenses to the Item Content in these
            Terms; (b) the Item Content, the Items, and the listing and sale
            contemplated by these Terms, complies with all, and do not and will not
            violate any applicable law, statute, rule, or regulation, will perform
            in accordance with the intended specifications and without material
            error, and will be delivered free and clear of any claims, liens or
            rights of third parties; (iii) the Item Content and Project SEED’s use
            thereof in accordance with these Terms does not and will not infringe
            any intellectual property rights of any third party or any right of
            privacy or publicity, or contain any libelous, defamatory, obscene or
            unlawful material, or otherwise violate or infringe any other right of
            any third party; (iv) you will fulfill your obligations under any terms
            with a Purchaser of the Items, as applicable; (v) any advertising or
            promotion of the Items by you or on your behalf will not constitute
            false, deceptive or unfair advertising or disparagement under any
            applicable laws and will not suggest a likely increase in value of the
            Items; and (vi) you will not use the proceeds retained from sales of the
            Item, whether through the Service or any other platform for capital
            raising purposes.&nbsp;

            The Service includes a marketplace, and Project SEED is not and shall
            not be a party to any transaction or dispute between the Minter of an
            Item and any actual or prospective purchaser or owner of that Item,
            whether arising from any rights granted in that Item or otherwise.

            By using the Service to Mint an Item, you hereby appoint Project SEED as
            your limited payments agent for the sole purpose of receiving, holding
            and settling payments due and owed to you arising out of (i) the Minting
            of Items through the Service; and (ii) any Secondary Sale of Items.
            Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Project SEED will process such
            payments and settle payments that are actually received by Project SEED,
            less any amounts owed to Project SEED, including taxes, fees and other
            obligations. You agree that a payment received by Project SEED on your
            behalf satisfies the payor’s obligation to make payment to you,
            regardless of whether Project SEED actually settles such payment to you.
            If Project SEED does not settle any such payments to you as described in
            these Terms, you will have recourse only against Project SEED and not
            the payor, as payment is deemed made by the payor to you upon
            constructive or actual receipt by Project SEED.

            Project SEED has no responsibility for the NFTs or Items created or

            regarding the authenticity, uniqueness, originality, quality,

            services to be performed. In the absence of an express legal agreement
            between the creator of NFTs or Items and purchasers of NFTs or Items,
            there cannot be any guarantee, warranty or assurance that the purchase
            or holding of the NFT or Item confers any license to or ownership of the

            The prices of digital assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the
            price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the
            Items, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. We
            cannot and do not guarantee that any purchasers of Items will not lose
            money.

            A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of
            distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those
            ecosystems and related applications, and could therefore also negatively
            impact the potential utility of Items.&nbsp;

          <p>
            You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to
            transactions involving your Items. Neither Project SEED nor any other
            Project SEED Entity is responsible for determining the taxes that may
            apply to transactions involving Items.

            Items exist and can be transferred only by virtue of the ownership
            record maintained on the blockchain supporting such Items. Our Service
            does not store, send, or receive Items. Any transfer of Items occurs
            within the supporting blockchain and not on the Service.

            There are risks associated with using digital currency, including but
            not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections,
            the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third
            parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your

            The publicly deployed smart contracts you interact with may contain
            security vulnerabilities, errors, &nbsp;failures, bugs or economic
            loopholes which may be exploited by third parties. Interaction with
            these smart contracts are entirely your own responsibility and
            liability, and Project SEED is not a party to these smart contracts.

          <p>
            The legal and regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies,
            cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or
            policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Service
            and the utility of Items.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            There are risks associated with purchasing user-generated User Content,
            including but not limited to, the risk of purchasing counterfeit assets,
            mislabeled assets, assets that are vulnerable to metadata decay, assets
            on smart contracts with bugs, and assets that may become untransferable.

            We do not control the public blockchains that you are interacting with
            and we do not control certain smart contracts and protocols that may be
            integral to your ability to complete transactions on these public
            blockchains. Additionally, blockchain transactions are irreversible and

            Project SEED reserves the right to hide collections, contracts, and
            assets that Project SEED suspects or believes may violate these Terms.
            Items you purchase may become inaccessible on the Service. Under no
            circumstances shall the inability to view your assets on the Service
            serve as grounds for a claim against Project SEED.

            Project SEED has no responsibility for the Items Minted, sold, bought or
            traded on the Service. Project SEED does not investigate and cannot
            guarantee or warrant the authenticity, originality, uniqueness,
            marketability, legality or value of any Item created or traded on the
            Service. For the avoidance of doubt, Project SEED shall have no
            responsibility for any failure of any User to comply with any terms
            regarding the authenticity, originality, uniqueness, scarcity or other
            description or characteristics of the Item furnished by or on behalf of
            that User and available via the Service.

            The Service relies on third-party platforms and/or vendors. If we are
            unable to maintain a good relationship with such platform providers
            and/or vendors; if the terms and conditions or pricing of such platform
            providers and/or vendors change; if we violate or cannot comply with the
            terms and conditions of such platforms and/or vendors; or if any of such
            platforms and/or vendors loses market share or falls out of favor or is
            unavailable for a prolonged period of time, access to and use of the
            Service will suffer.

        costs (including, without limitation, court costs, costs of settlement, and
        costs of or associated with pursuing indemnification and insurance), of
        every kind and nature whatsoever arising out of or related to these Terms or
        your use of the Service, whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen,
        matured or unmatured, or suspected or unsuspected, in law or equity, whether
        in tort, contract or otherwise (collectively, “Claims”), including, but not
        limited to, damages to property or personal injury, that are caused by,
        arise out of or are related to (a) your use or misuse of the Service, User
        Content or Items, (b) any feedback you provide, (c) your violation of these
        Terms, and (d) your violation of the rights of any third party, including
        another user. You agree to promptly notify Project SEED of any third-party
        Claims and cooperate with the Project SEED Entities in defending such
        Claims. You further agree that the Project SEED Entities shall have control
        of the defense or settlement of any third-party Claims. THIS INDEMNITY IS IN
        ADDITION TO, AND NOT IN LIEU OF, ANY OTHER INDEMNITIES SET FORTH IN A
        SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND Project SEED.

        WE WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOSSES YOU SUSTAIN AS A
        RESULT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE. WE TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR, AND WILL
        NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR, ANY USE OF ITEMS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY

      <p>
        FROM TIME TO TIME, PROJECT SEED MAY OFFER NEW “BETA” FEATURES OR TOOLS. SUCH
        FEATURES OR TOOLS ARE OFFERED “AS IS” AND WITH ALL FAULTS, SOLELY FOR
        EXPERIMENTAL PURPOSES AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND MAY BE
        MODIFIED OR DISCONTINUED AT PROJECT SEED’S SOLE DISCRETION. THE PROVISIONS
        OF THIS SECTION APPLY WITH FULL FORCE TO SUCH FEATURES OR TOOLS.
      </p>
      <p>
        ITEMS ARE INTANGIBLE DIGITAL ASSETS. THEY EXIST ONLY BY VIRTUE OF THE
        OWNERSHIP RECORD MAINTAINED IN THE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK. ANY TRANSFER OF TITLE
        THAT MIGHT OCCUR IN ANY UNIQUE DIGITAL ASSET OCCURS ON THE DECENTRALIZED
        LEDGER WITHIN THE APPLICABLE BLOCKCHAIN PLATFORM. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT
        PROJECT SEED OR ANY PROJECT SEED ENTITY CAN EFFECT THE TRANSFER OF TITLE OR
        RIGHT IN ANY ITEMS. WE CANNOT AND DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT ANY ITEM WILL HAVE
        OR RETAIN ANY INHERENT VALUE, OR THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SELL OR RESELL ANY
        ITEM PURCHASED THROUGH THE SERVICE.
      </p>
      <p>
        Project SEED is not responsible for any losses or harms sustained by you due
        to vulnerability or any kind of failure, abnormal behavior of software
        (e.g., wallet, smart contract), blockchains, or any other features of or
        inherent to the Items. Project SEED is not responsible for casualties due to
        developers or representatives&apos; delay or failure to report any issues with
        any blockchain supporting Items, including without limitation forks,
        technical node issues, or any other issues that result in losses of any
        sort.

      <p>
        Nothing in these Terms shall exclude or limit liability of either party for
        fraud, death or bodily injury caused by negligence, violation of laws, or
        any other activity that cannot be limited or excluded under the laws
        applicable to your jurisdiction. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
        EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES IN CONTRACTS WITH CONSUMERS, SO THE ABOVE
        EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
      </p>
      <h4>17. Limitation of Liability</h4>
      <p>
        TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PROJECT SEED BE
        LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFIT OR ANY INDIRECT,
        CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING
        FROM THESE TERMS, THE SERVICE, ANY ITEMS, OR FOR ANY DAMAGES RELATED TO LOSS
        OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS
        OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR LOSS OF DATA, AND WHETHER CAUSED BY TORT
        (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF
        FORESEEABLE AND EVEN IF PROJECT SEED HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
        SUCH DAMAGES. ACCESS TO, AND USE OF, THE SERVICE IS UNDERTAKEN BY YOU AT
        YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY
        DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA RESULTING
        THEREFROM.
      </p>
      <p>
        NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, IN NO EVENT SHALL
        THE MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF ORIGIN ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY
        RELATED TO THESE TERMS, YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE, CONTENT
        (INCLUDING YOUR CONTENT), OR ANY ITEMS PURCHASED OR SOLD THROUGH THE SERVICE
        EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) $100 OR (B) THE AMOUNT PAID TO PROJECT SEED BY YOU
        FOR THE SERVICE IN THE TRANSACTION OR INCIDENT THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE
        CLAIM. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY EVEN IF THE ABOVE STATED REMEDY
        FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
        consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to
        you.

      <h4>18. Dispute Resolution/Arbitration</h4>
      <p>
        Dispute Resolution. Please read the arbitration agreement in this section
        (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It contains procedures for MANDATORY
        BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You agree that all claims and
            disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as
            set forth below) in connection with these Terms or the use of any
            Service provided by Project SEED that cannot be resolved informally or
            in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an
            individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless
            otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in
            English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and Project SEED, and
            to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in
            interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or
            unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under
            these Terms.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before either party
            may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a
            written notice describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute
            and the requested relief (“Notice of Dispute”). A Notice of Dispute to
            Project SEED should be sent to: PT. Benih Permainan Internasional, Jl.
            Sultan Iskandar Muda 18F, Jakarta Selatan, Indonesia. After the Notice
            of Dispute is received, you and Project SEED may attempt to resolve the
            claim or dispute informally. Both you and Project SEED agree to meet and
            confer personally, by telephone, or by videoconference (hereinafter
            “Conference”) to discuss the dispute and attempt in good faith to reach
            a mutually beneficial outcome that avoids the expenses of arbitration
            or, where applicable, litigation. If you are represented by counsel,
            your counsel may participate in the Conference as well, but you agree to
            fully participate in the Conference. Likewise, if Project SEED is
            represented by counsel, its counsel may participate in the Conference as
            well, but Project SEED agrees to have a company representative fully
            participate in the Conference. The statute of limitations and any filing
            fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal
            dispute resolution process and Conference required by this paragraph. If
            you and Project SEED do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty
            (30) days after the Notice of Dispute is received, either party may
            begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made
            by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the
            arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which
            either party is entitled.

            Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated through the Singapore
            International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”), an established alternative
            dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as
            set forth in this section. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern
            all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method
            of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such
            rules are in conflict with these Terms. The Arbitration Rules of
            Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“Arbitration Rules”)
            governing the arbitration are available online at
            https://www.siac.org.sg/. The arbitration shall be conducted by a
            single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total
            amount of the award sought is less than Six Thousand Singapore Dollars
            (SGD $6,000.00) may be resolved through Expedited Procedure, at the
            option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the
            total amount of the award sought is Six Thousand Singapore Dollars (SGD
            $6,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the
            Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100
            miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of Singapore, and
            unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of Singapore.,
            the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date,
            time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered
            by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
            If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last
            settlement offer that Project SEED made to you prior to the initiation
            of arbitration, Project SEED will pay you the greater of the award or
            $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s
            fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an
            equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.

        <li>
          <p>
            Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. If non-appearance based arbitration is
            elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or
            based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen
            by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not
            involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless
            otherwise agreed by the parties.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Time Limits. If you or Project SEED pursues arbitration, the arbitration
            action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of
            limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any
            deadline imposed under the SIAC Rules for the pertinent claim.

        <li>
          <p>
            Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator
            will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Project SEED,
            and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or
            joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have
            exclusive authority to (i) determine the scope and enforceability of
            this Arbitration Agreement; and (ii) resolve any dispute related to the
            interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this
            Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all
            or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable; and shall
            also have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of
            any claim. The exceptions to the preceding sentence are (1) all disputes
            arising out of or relating to the class action waiver, including any
            claim that all or part of the class action waiver is unenforceable,
            illegal, void or voidable, or such class action waiver has been
            breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not
            by an arbitrator; (2) all disputes arising out of or relating to the
            payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of
            competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (3) all disputes
            arising out of or relating to whether either party has satisfied any
            condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of
            competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The arbitrator shall
            have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any
            non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under
            applicable law, the SIAC Rules, and these Terms. The arbitrator shall
            issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential
            findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the
            calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same
            authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court
            of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon
            you and Project SEED. Any judgment on the award rendered by the
            arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

            Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND
            STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR
            A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved
            by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures
            are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules
            applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court.
            In the event any litigation should arise between you and Project SEED in
            any state or country court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration
            award or otherwise, YOU AND PROJECT SEED WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY
            TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN
            THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED
            ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN
            ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR
            CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If a decision is
            issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this
            subsection’s limitations as to a given claim for relief, then the claim
            must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the court of
            Singapore. All other claims shall be arbitrated.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including
            but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith,
            shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain
            confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall
            not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information
            necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or
            to seek injunctive or equitable relief.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are
            found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of
            competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no
            force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the
            Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

            Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the

            Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Project

        <li>
          <p>
            Emergency Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party
            may seek emergency equitable relief before a court in order to maintain
            the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall
            not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this
            Arbitration Agreement.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Claims Not Subject to Arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims
            of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and
            infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright,
            trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration
            Agreement.

            Courts. In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement
            permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to
            submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within
            Singapore, for such purpose.

        shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws
        of Singapore, without regard to any conflict of law rules or principles that
        would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any

        heard in small claims court, shall be resolved in the courts of Singapore,
        sitting in Singapore. Notwithstanding anything contained in these Terms, we
        reserve the right, without notice and in our sole discretion, to terminate
        your right to access or use the Service at any time and for any or no
