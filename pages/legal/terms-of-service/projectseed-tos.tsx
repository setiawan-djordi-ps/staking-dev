      </p>
      <h2>2. Purchases in the Services</h2>
      <p>
        Project Seed may license to you certain virtual goods or other content (e.g.
        in-game items or currency) which may be used within the Services and which
        you may purchase with “real world” money or earn or redeem through gameplay
        (“Virtual Items”). Virtual Items are licensed to you on a limited, personal,
        non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable basis solely for
        non-commercial use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless expressly authorized in the Services, you may only purchase Virtual
        Items from Project Seed or its authorized partner and the transfer or sale
        of Virtual Items is prohibited.
      </p>
      <p>
        Virtual Items do not have an equivalent value in real world money and are
        not a substitute for real world money. Neither Project Seed nor any other
        person or entity has any obligation to exchange Virtual Items for anything
        of value. Project Seed is not liable for hacking or loss of your Virtual
        Items.
      </p>
      <p>
        Price and availability of Virtual Items are subject to change without
        notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        All purchases and redemptions of Virtual Items made through the Services are
        final and non-refundable. You acknowledge and consent that Virtual Items are
        provided to you immediately upon purchase and that you forfeit any right to
        cancel or withdraw from the purchase once the process has commenced.
        Accordingly, you agree that Project Seed is not required to provide a refund
        for Virtual Items for any reason. You further acknowledge that you will not
        receive money or other compensation for unused Virtual Items, regardless of
        whether your loss of license under these TOS was voluntary or involuntary.
        The foregoing does not affect your rights under applicable law, including
        those you may have based on the legal guarantee of conformity described in
        Section “Disclaimer”.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you ask for your personal data to be deleted as described in Project
        Seed’s Privacy Notice, you will permanently forfeit all of your Virtual
        Items without the right to refund, as Project Seed will no longer be able
        associate such Virtual Items with you.
      </p>
      <h2>3. Right of Withdrawal</h2>
      <p>
        If you are a consumer based in the European Union or a member country of the
        European Economic Area (“EEA”), this Section applies to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may have the right to withdraw from these TOS within 14 days from the
        day you agreed to them. You may also have the right to withdraw from the
        purchase of a license to a Virtual Item or a Service within 14 days from
        purchase. You are not required to give a reason for exercising the right of
        withdrawal. However, you are not entitled to withdraw from a purchase if you
        have consented to the Virtual Item or Service being fully provided to you
        during the withdrawal period and acknowledged that you thereby forfeit your
        right of withdrawal.
      </p>
      <p>
        To withdraw from these TOS, you must inform Project Seed of your decision to
        withdraw and discontinue your use of the Services. To withdraw from the
        purchase of a license to a Virtual Item or a Service, you must inform the
        merchant of record, which may be either Project Seed or its authorized
        partner through whom you made the purchase. Please note that Project Seed is
        neither able nor required to fulfill your request to withdraw from a
        purchase where Project Seed is not the merchant of record.
      </p>
      <p>
        To inform Project Seed of your decision to withdraw, you must send an
        equivocal statement of your decision by email to contact@projectseed.com.
        Please submit your notice of withdrawal before the expiration of your 14
        days.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you withdraw from the purchase of a license to a Virtual Item or a
        Service, you are entitled to be reimbursed for the purchase without undue
        delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which you
        informed the merchant of record of your decision to withdraw from the
        purchase. The reimbursement will be carried out using the same means of
        payment as you used for the initial payment, unless you have agreed
        otherwise. You will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.
      </p>

        or for no reason at any time. If at any time Project Seed chooses, at its
        sole discretion, to monitor the Services, Project Seed nonetheless assumes
        no responsibility for content made available by users of the Services, and
        Project Seed assumes no obligation to modify or remove any inappropriate
        content.
      </p>
      <p>
        You acknowledge that Project Seed is not a party to any dispute you may have
        with any other user(s) of the Services. Project Seed has no obligation to
        become involved in any such dispute. You release Project Seed and its
        subsidiaries (and Project Seed’s and its subsidiaries’ officers, directors,
        agents, joint ventures, shareholders and employees) from all claims,
        demands, and damages related to any such dispute.
      </p>
      <h2>8. Arbitration</h2>
      <p>
        At Company’s sole discretion, it may require you to submit any disputes
        arising from these Terms of Use or use of the Website, including disputes
        arising from or concerning their interpretation, violation, invalidity,
        non-performance, or termination, to final and binding arbitration under the
        Rules of Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association applying Texas
        law.
      </p>
      <p>Limitation on Time to File Claims</p>
      <p>
        ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
        THESE TERMS OF USE OR THE WEBSITE MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER
        THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACTUALLY ACCRUES; OTHERWISE, YOU AGREE THAT SUCH CAUSE
        OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.
      </p>
      <h2>9. Suspension and Termination for your Breach</h2>
      <p>
        Without limiting any other remedies available to Project Seed, if Project
        Seed believes that you are in breach of these TOS, Project Seed reserves the
        right to take any of the following actions, whether individually or in
        combination, and either with or without notice to you: (i) delete, suspend,
        and/or modify your Account or parts of your Account; (ii) limit, suspend
        and/or terminate your access to the Services; (iii) modify and/or remove any
        of your Virtual Items; (iv) reset and/or modify any game progression or
        benefits and privileges associated with you, such as any level or score you
        have reached in the Services.
      </p>
      <h2>10. Availability, Compatibility, and Changes to the Services</h2>
      <p>
        Project Seed does not guarantee that the Services are always available or
        will continue to be available in the future. The Services may be temporarily
        unavailable due to technical issues or maintenance related reasons, which
        may occur on a scheduled or unscheduled basis. Furthermore, the Services or
        parts thereof may be designed to be available only for a limited time (e.g.
        when content is seasonal or early access is provided to a development
        version of a game), or their life cycle may be affected by technological
        developments or changes in consumer behavior. Accordingly, Project Seed
        reserves the right to stop offering and/or supporting the Services or parts
        thereof (e.g. a game or a feature of a game) at any time, at which point
        your license to use the Services or such parts thereof will be terminated
        automatically. In such an event, unless otherwise required by applicable
        law, Project Seed does not have to provide refunds for the Services or any
        Virtual Items. Where appropriate, Project Seed will take reasonable measures
        to provide advance notice when any Services or parts thereof are
        discontinued. However, Project Seed may limit, suspend or terminate the
        Services or parts thereof without notice, and take technical and legal steps
        to prevent you from accessing the Services, if Project Seed believes you or
        any other user(s) are causing a risk of legal liability or infringement of
        third-party intellectual property rights or are not acting in accordance
        with the letter or spirit of these TOS.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Services may have limited compatibility across different devices and
        operating systems. You are responsible for verifying that the Services are
        compatible with your device and its operating system. Generally, more
        information regarding compatibility requirements is available at the point
        of first use or download (e.g. in the relevant app store).
      </p>
      <p>
        The Services are intended to evolve over time. Accordingly, Project Seed may
        change, manage, modify, or update the Services or parts thereof (including,
        but not limited to, Virtual Items) from time to time. This may result in
        content or features being added, removed, or modified (e.g. gameplay modes
        or areas being added or removed or Virtual Items having their appearance or
        power altered). Project Seed may, at its sole discretion, make any such
        changes as it believes to be necessary to maintain and improve the Services,
        including, but not limited to, introducing, modifying, or removing game
        content and features according to Project Seed’s development roadmap,
        adapting to new technologies, reflecting changes to Project Seed’s
        agreements with third parties, preventing abuse or technical issues, and
        addressing any legal, safety, or regulatory requirements. When changes are
        made to the Services, you may be required to download and install an update
        to continue using them. If you do not, you may be unable to access or use
        the Services or parts thereof (e.g. online play and features may only be
        available to those who are using the latest version of a game).
      </p>
      <h2>11. Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, the Services are
        provided to you “AS IS,” without warranty, assurances, or guarantees of any
        kind. The Services may have defects, and your use is solely at your risk.
        Project Seed does not make, and hereby disclaims any and all express,
        implied or statutory warranties, including implied warranties of condition,
        uninterrupted use, accuracy of data (including, but not limited to, location
        data), merchantability, satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular
        purpose, non-infringement of third-party rights, and warranties (if any)
        arising in the course of dealing, usage, or trade practices. Project Seed
        does not warrant against interference with your enjoyment of the Services;
        that the Services will meet your requirements; that operation of the
        Services will be uninterrupted or error-free; that the Services will
        interoperate or be compatible with any other services; or, that any errors
        in the Services will be corrected. No oral or written advice provided by
        Project Seed, its employees or other representatives constitute a warranty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some jurisdictions do not allow disclaimers such as those above; thus, the
        above terms may not apply to you. Instead, in such jurisdictions, the
        foregoing disclaimers shall only apply to the extent permitted by the laws
        of such jurisdictions. Moreover, you may have additional legal rights in
        your jurisdiction, and nothing in these TOS shall infringe upon the
        statutory rights that you may have as a consumer of the Services.
        Specifically, if you are a consumer based in the EEA, you are provided with
        a legal guarantee of conformity under which Project Seed may be liable for a
        lack of conformity that you discover: (i) within two years from any one-time
        supply of the Services (such as the supply of a Virtual Item); or (ii) at
        any time during any continuous supply of the Services.
      </p>
      <h2>12. Limitations of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        In no event will Project Seed be liable for special, incidental, or
        consequential damages resulting from access, use or malfunction of the
        Services, including, but not limited to, damages to property, loss of
        goodwill, device failure or malfunction and, to the extent permitted by law,
        damages for personal injuries, property damage, lost profits or punitive
        damages from any causes of action arising out of or related to these TOS or
        the Services, whether arising in tort (including negligence), contract,
        strict liability or otherwise and whether or not Project Seed has been
        advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event will Project Seed’s
        total aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with these TOS,
        the Privacy Notice, or the Services exceed the higher of: (i) the actual
        price (if any) you paid for the license to use Virtual Items or Services; or
        (ii) 100 US dollars. The exclusions and limitations of damages are
        fundamental elements of the basis of the agreement between Project Seed and
        you. For purposes of this Section “Limitations of Liability,” Project Seed’s
        licensors and other partners are third-party beneficiaries to the
        limitations of liability specified herein and may enforce these TOS against
        you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations of liability such as
        those stated in this Section; thus, the above terms may not apply to you.
        Instead, in such jurisdictions, the limitations of liability in this Section
        shall apply only to the extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdictions.
        Moreover, you may have additional legal rights in your jurisdiction, and
        nothing in these TOS will infringe upon any statutory rights you may have as
        a consumer of the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Project Seed and its subsidiaries
        (and Project Seed’s and its subsidiaries’ officers, directors, agents, joint
        ventures, shareholders and employees) harmless from any claim, demand,
        damages, or other losses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, asserted by
        any third party resulting from or arising out of your use of the Services or
        any breach by you of these TOS; however, the foregoing does not apply if the
        third-party claim is not attributable to your intentional or negligent
        behavior.
      </p>
      <h2>13. Copyright and DMCA</h2>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>

        its users. If you are unsure whether the material or activity you are

        The Services may link to or otherwise make available third-party products or
        services, including, but not limited to, through third-party advertisements,

        third party’s terms and conditions. Please read these third-party terms and
        conditions carefully as they constitute an agreement between you and the
        relevant third-party service provider to which Project Seed is not a party.

        regarding the content, goods or services provided by such third parties.
        Project Seed is not liable to you for any losses or harm caused by such
        third parties or any charges you incur in relation to such third parties.
        You understand that when you provide data to such third parties you are
        providing it in accordance with their privacy policy (if any) and you
        understand Project Seed’s Privacy Notice does not apply to such data.
      </p>
      <h2>15. Changes to these TOS</h2>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding Section “Arbitration,” Project Seed may update these TOS
        from time to time in response to changing legal, technical or business
        developments. When Project Seed updates these TOS, Project Seed will take
        appropriate measures to inform you via the Services or otherwise, in
        accordance with the significance of the changes made.
      </p>
      <p>

        you agree to be bound by the updated TOS.
      </p>

        offices within the State of Texas, United States of America. It can be
        accessed from all 50 states, as well as from other countries around the
        world. As each of these places has laws that may differ from those of Texas,
        by accessing the Service both of us agree that the statutes and laws of the
        State of Texas, without regard to the conflicts of laws principles thereof
        and the United Nations Convention on the International Sales of Goods, will
        apply to all matters relating to the use of the Service and the purchase of
        products and services. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal
        jurisdiction and venue of the District Court of Dallas County and the United
        States District Court for the Dallas District of Texas with respect to such
        matters.
      </p>
      <h2>17. General</h2>
      <p>

        Project Seed regarding the Services and supersede all earlier agreements and
        understandings between you and Project Seed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assignment. Project Seed may assign these TOS, in whole or in part, to any
        person or entity at any time with or without your consent, provided that
        such assignment does not reduce your rights under these TOS. You may not
        assign or delegate any rights or obligations under these TOS without Project
        Seed’s prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment and delegation
        by you is void.
      </p>
      <p>
        Severability. If any provision of these TOS is held to be invalid or
        unenforceable, such provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum
        extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these TOS will remain in
        full force and effect. Project Seed’s failure to enforce any right or
        provision of these TOS will not be deemed a waiver of such right or
        provision.
      </p>
      <p>
        No Waiver. Any failure by Project Seed to exercise or enforce any of its
        rights under these TOS does not waive its right to enforce such right. Any
        waiver of such rights shall only be effective if made in writing and signed
        by an authorized representative of Project Seed.

      <h2>18. Additional Terms for Apple Users</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to the terms set forth above, the following terms apply if you
        are accessing the Services using devices by Apple Inc. (“Apple”).
      </p>
      <p>
        You acknowledge and agree that these TOS are concluded between you and
        Project Seed, not with Apple, and that Project Seed, not Apple, is
        responsible for the Services and their content. The license granted to you
        under these TOS is subject to the permitted usage rules specified in the
        Apple App Store Terms of Service and any third-party terms of agreement
        therein. You must comply with any third-party terms and conditions that
        apply to your use of the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Project Seed, not Apple, is responsible to you for: (i) providing any
        relevant maintenance or support for the Services in accordance with these
        TOS; and (ii) addressing any claims you may have regarding the Services,
        including product liability claims, any claim that the Services fail to
        conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement, and claims
        arising under consumer protection or similar laws. If the Services fail to
        conform to the warranties or other conditions set forth in these TOS or
        applicable law, you may notify Apple, after which Apple may refund the
        purchase price (if any) for the relevant Services. To the maximum extent
        permitted by applicable law, Apple has no other warranty obligation with
        respect to the Services.
      </p>
      <p>

        and use of the Services infringes a third party’s intellectual property
        rights, Apple will not be responsible for the investigation, defense,
        settlement, or discharge of any such intellectual property infringement
        claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        You represent and warrant that: (i) you are not located in a country that is
        subject to a U.S. government embargo, or that has been designated by the
        U.S. government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not
        listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries to these TOS. Upon
        your acceptance of these TOS, you agree that Apple has the right to enforce
        these TOS against you as a third-party beneficiary.
